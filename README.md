# C# algorithms: Quick Sort, Bubble Sort , Bucket Sort

The aim of this project was to learn computer algorithms using C# programming! 

Specifically, I have implemented Quick Sort, Bubble Sort , Bucket Sort algorithms in order to practice my C# skills as well as have a little bit of fun coding :)


P.S. this is an exercise from The C# PeopleCert Bootcamp, a 6-month course (500 hrs) that aims to provide a complete path for students to go from zero to employed as web developers while working with other students along the way. Check this out: (https://peoplecerteducation.org/bootcamp/)
